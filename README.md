# transport_problem

Truckloads of gas are to be shipped from two plants to five customers every month. 

Plants have a maximum capacity (supply) and customers have a demand to be fulfilled (demand), both measured in terms of truckloads.

Shipping each truck load from a plant to a customer has an associated transport cost.

The problem consists in obtaining the transportation plan with the minimum cost fulfilling all customers demand given the supply capacity of each plant.

The following tables provide the relevant input data:
